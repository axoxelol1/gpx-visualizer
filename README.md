# GPX visualizer

A small website to simultaneously visualize Strava runs.

I've only tested it with exported Strava activities (note that you only get timestamps for your own activities).
It should work with any GPX file that has timestamps though.

## Development/deployment

1. Install dependencies with `npm i`.
1. Use `npm run dev` to test locally
1. Use `npm run build` to generate a static site.
